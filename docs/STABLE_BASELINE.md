# RemoEdPH Stable Baseline

Working beta surfaces that new features should **extend around**, not rewrite. Agents: also follow [`.cursor/rules/remoed-stable-surfaces.mdc`](../.cursor/rules/remoed-stable-surfaces.mdc).

Treat **repo `main` after a successful production deploy** as the source of truth. Re-run this checklist after every VPS restart / deploy.

## Critical file paths

| Area | Files |
|------|--------|
| Portal tokens | `public/js/user-session.js`, `public/js/remoed-auth-token.js`, `server/authMiddleware.js` |
| Student book UI | `public/student-book.html` |
| Book API | `server/student.js` (`POST /book-class`), `server/studentController.js`, `server/services/studentBookSlotService.js`, legacy `POST /api/teacher/book-class` in `server/teacher.js` |
| Teacher ID resolve | `server/services/teacherSlotResolve.js`, `teacherBookingKey` in `server/teacher.js` |
| Credits / expiry | `server/services/studentCreditSummary.js`, `server/services/creditExpiry.js` |
| Class schedule / issue | `public/teacher-class-table.html`, `POST /report-issue` + `GET /check-class-issues` in `server/teacher.js` |
| Applicant → teacher docs | `server/utils/applicantDocuments.js`, teacher signup in `server/auth.js` |
| Live classroom (AV / locks) | `public/live-classroom.html`, `public/css/live-classroom-redesign.css`, `public/js/virtual-background.js`, `public/images/virtual-bg/`, socket maps in `server/index.js` |
| Responsive / overlays | `public/css/remoed-layers.css` (breakpoints, sidebar offset, z-index tokens) |
| Mongo safety scripts | `scripts/archive-legacy-mongo-db.js`, `scripts/purge-beta-recordings.js` |

## Feature-add rule of thumb

1. Prefer new endpoints under `/api/student/...` or `/api/teacher/...` with thin wrappers.
2. Touch shared middleware (`authMiddleware`), book-slot service, or teacher-id resolve **only** when the feature cannot work otherwise.
3. If students need another teacher-mounted route, **extend** the `studentMayCallThisTeacherRoute` allowlist — do not remove portal gates.
4. Before push: `node --check server/student.js` (and any other edited server entry files). Never duplicate `require('./studentController')` in `server/student.js`.

## Smoke checklist (before and after a feature PR)

### Health / data

- [ ] `GET /api/health` returns OK and `databaseName: "test"`.
- [ ] Local/production `MONGODB_URI` still points at `/test` (not a blank path or `online-distance-learning`).
- [ ] Lesson library presentations still load (GridFS `presentations/` untouched).

### Student booking

- [ ] Signed-in student with `creditBalance > 0` can open **Book a Class**, see open slots, and complete `POST /api/student/book-class` (Network 2xx).
- [ ] Student with expired / zero credits gets a clear credit/subscription error code, not a 500 or `WRONG_PORTAL_TOKEN`.
- [ ] Booking for a teacher whose slot `teacherId` is a username (not email) still succeeds when the UI sends their email.

### Teacher schedule / issue

- [ ] Class Schedule loads without console `resolveTeacherPortalToken is not defined`.
- [ ] Teacher can open a booked class → **Report Issue** → submit with screenshot → success toast.
- [ ] After submit, schedule refresh does not clear the teacher session.

### Live classroom (teacher Settings + student locks)

- [ ] Teacher **Settings** gear (tab bar) opens the overlay — not a dropdown clipped under the lesson stage.
- [ ] Unchecking **Videos tab** hides Videos for the student and bounces them to Lesson; teacher Videos still works.
- [ ] Unchecking **Pen / annotate** stops student drawing on the lesson and the board; teacher pen still works. Leaving Board still sends students back to Lesson.
- [ ] **Student microphone** / **Student camera** switches match the rail pills: one side of each pair is highlighted (Allow = green, Mute/Cam off = amber). Student is muted / cam-off until Allow.
- [ ] **Your camera background** in Settings applies Off / Blur / Office / Classroom / Nature / Custom on the teacher camera (photos under `public/images/virtual-bg/*.jpg`). Hard-refresh after deploy so `?v=` cache-bust is not stale.

### Auth isolation

- [ ] Student token cannot call a random `/api/teacher/*` route outside the allowlist (`WRONG_PORTAL_TOKEN`).
- [ ] Teacher token cannot call `/api/student/*` profile/bookings as a student.

### Portal / classroom responsive

- [ ] Phone (375px): student/teacher/admin `.remoed-content` has **no** 260px left gutter; **no sidebar drawer**. App chrome is a titled top bar + 4 tabs + More sheet (`#remoed-more-sheet` on `document.body`).
- [ ] Desktop (1440px): content is offset by `--sidebar-width` (260px); tablet 769–1024 keeps the icon rail.
- [ ] Classroom Settings / VBG / class-info stay body-level and use `--z-modal` / `--z-toast` / `--z-blocking` from `public/css/remoed-layers.css`. Classroom phone dock stays Lesson / Camera / Chat (no portal tabs).

### Deploy hygiene

- [ ] No second `const studentController = require(...)` in `server/student.js`.
- [ ] Hard-refresh portals after deploy (`Ctrl+F5`) so cached HTML/JS is not stale.

## Live classroom — do not “simplify”

These were easy to regress. Extend them; do not flatten to a checkbox in the tab bar or delete the in-memory room maps.

### Teacher Settings overlay

- Gear is `#lc-class-settings-btn`. Panel lives in **`#lc-class-settings-overlay`** (body-level, `z-index: var(--z-modal)`). Do not put the panel back inside `.tabs` / `.center-panel` — both clip or paint over it (`overflow: hidden`, `backdrop-filter`).
- Overlay holds: Videos tab, Pen / annotate, student mic, student camera, and **Your camera background** (`#lc-settings-vbg-panel`). Teacher BG tile may open this same overlay.
- Cache-bust `live-classroom-redesign.css` and `virtual-background.js` query strings when those files change.

### Socket `classroom-settings` (`videosAllowed`, `penAllowed`)

- Source of truth: `classroomSettingsByRoom` via `applyClassroomSettings` / `defaultClassroomSettings()` in `server/index.js`.
- Teacher emit may arrive **before** async `join` finishes. Queue on `pendingClassroomSettingsBySocket` and flush in `join` / `join-room`. Do not ignore early emits.
- Teacher `join` payload may include `videosAllowed: false` and/or `penAllowed: false` from `sessionStorage` (`remoed_lc_settings_*`). After join, re-emit **only** stored locks — never broadcast default `true` and unlock the room.
- Students pull state with `classroom-settings-request` after connect. Always send current settings to joiners.
- **Do not** `classroomSettingsByRoom.delete` when the last socket leaves. A teacher refresh must not unlock Videos/pen.
- Client: students hide `#lc-videos-tab-btn` + `#videos-panel` when locked (`body.lc-student-videos-locked`). Pen lock sets `window.__lcStudentPenAllowed` and gates PDF annotate + whiteboard (`body.lc-student-pen-locked`). Teacher can still draw. `whiteboard-mode-stop` still sends students to Lesson.

### Teacher → student mic / camera

- Socket `media-control` + `media-control-state`. Payload `audio`/`video` **true** = allowed, **false** = locked.
- Rail is four pills **outside** the peer video tile (`#lc-teacher-media-controls`). Do not put `video-control-btn` (30px circles) on these labels — that stacked “MuteAllowicam”.
- Exclusive pairs: sync `is-active` on **both** Allow and Mute/Cam off (`syncTeacherMediaUi`). Settings checkboxes `#lc-setting-student-mic` / `#lc-setting-student-cam` must stay in sync.

### Virtual backgrounds

- `public/js/virtual-background.js` is **canvas-first**. Presets are real JPEGs: `office.jpg`, `classroom.jpg`, `nature.jpg`. Keep SVG files only as unused leftovers; do not point presets back at `.svg` (canvas load / taint failed).
- Remap stored `*.svg` preset URLs to `.jpg` in `applyMode`. Do not let `applyTeacherCameraReadyLook()` overwrite an active VBG (`mode !== 'off'`).
- MediaPipe person cutout is optional; blur and photo presets must work without it.

## Responsive / overlay contract

Do not “fix” overlaps by inventing a higher raw `z-index`. Use [public/css/remoed-layers.css](../public/css/remoed-layers.css).

- Breakpoints: phone `≤768`, tablet `769–1024`, desktop `≥1025`. Classroom column stack may stay at 1100px. **Do not add 560 / 720 / 992** for new portal rules.
- Sidebar offset: `--sidebar-width` (260) / `--sidebar-collapsed` (72). On phone, `.remoed-content` margin is 0 (token sheet). Phone has **no sidebar drawer** — overflow is the More sheet (`#remoed-more-sheet`, `--z-modal`). Tablet keeps the 76px icon rail; desktop keeps 260px. Do not restore `global-portal.css` `max-width: 992px` teacher drawer (`z-index: 9999`).
- Layers: `--z-base` 1, `--z-sticky` 100, `--z-drawer-backdrop` 200, `--z-drawer` 210, `--z-dropdown` 400, `--z-classroom-chrome` 6000, `--z-modal` 9000, `--z-toast` 9500, `--z-blocking` 100000.
- Dialogs (Settings, VBG, class-info, issue, toasts) are `position: fixed` on `document.body`. A parent with `overflow: hidden`, `transform`, `filter`, or `backdrop-filter` cannot host a popover.
- Phone tap targets ≥ 44px. Do not put `.video-control-btn` (30px circles) on labeled classroom actions.

## Known product gates (not bugs)

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `SUBSCRIPTION_REQUIRED_LESSON_2` | Not subscribed / no credits / no trial |
| `CREDITS_EXPIRED` | Unused credits expired after validity window |
| `INSUFFICIENT_CREDITS` | `creditBalance` is 0 |
| `TRIAL_LESSON_1_ONLY` | Free trial may only book Lesson 1 |
| `WRONG_PORTAL_TOKEN` | Wrong role token for this API path |

## Ops notes (out of code scope)

- Atlas M0 storage % may stay high after deletes; Flex upgrade / MongoDB for Startups credits are billing ops.
- Launch wipe of beta users is a separate explicit task — do not drop `test` casually.
